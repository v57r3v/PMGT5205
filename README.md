5.          Work   Breakdown   Structure (10   Marks)
Based on their   understanding   of the   scenario   (extended   by   discussions on Canvas)   the   PM   and   project team developed the following   preliminary   high-level WBS for   estimating the first   launch   of   Pacificano   Markets:

a)    Review/ critique the   above   (preliminary   Level-2) WBS   and   use   the   definition   and/or   the   project   scenario to   identify:
•         At   least two   positive   (good) things about the WBS   above, and,
•         At   least two   negatives   (bad/weak/missed) things about the WBS.Note: You   may   need to “interview” the   Pacificano   Mayor   (via the Canvas   Discussion Thread) to      better   understand the WBS above. After confirming with   lecturers, teams   have   the   flexibility   to   adjust the structure/headings so   long   as   it does   not change   the   scope.
b)       Use your team’s amended   WBS   to   identify   at   least   2 to   4   (max)   realistic   work   packages   under   each of the above   (Level-2) work   breakdown to   show   (at   least   12)   Level-3   work   packages.
c)         Present the WBS   in a table and for   each   of   your   Level-3   work   packages:
o   Briefly   describe/ explain   (~10 words or   less) the   product/service that would   be   provided/   delivered   by that work   package
o   Identify some   relevant activities that would   need to   be   conducted to   deliver   that   product/service
